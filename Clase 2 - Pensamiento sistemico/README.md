Beamer theme for the computer science program at Universidad Rafael Landivar

At some Brazilian Computer Science event (I think it was at SbSeg '12) I saw that many computer science students at Brazil accustom to present their slides with a graphic style provided by their program (Very cool IMHO).
	 
However the information systems program at URL (http://www.url.edu.gt) didn't have its own style. Hence, based on a previous template created for my master's degree (https://github.com/tuxtor/infufsmbeamertheme)  I did this small adaptation for my lectures.
